Welcome to A I Ethics Fundamentals.

I'm Amanda, the Chief Learning Officer at writingIO. This mini course explores how to use A I responsibly and ethically.

This video and all videos in this course were created with an A I tool, allowing us to keep content current.

A I is powerful. That power comes with responsibility. How you use A I affects not just you but potentially many others.

Ethical A I use isn't about following complicated rules. It's about asking good questions. Is this honest? Is this fair? Am I being transparent? Could this cause harm?

These questions matter because A I amplifies human capabilities. It can amplify both good intentions and bad ones. It can spread information faster, including misinformation. It can affect decisions at scale.

As A I becomes more prevalent, ethical use becomes more important.

In this mini course, you'll learn core principles for ethical A I use, how to recognize and address bias, the importance of transparency and honesty, and frameworks for making ethical decisions.

This isn't about being perfect. It's about being thoughtful. Let's explore how to use A I well.
