Transparency about A I use builds trust and maintains integrity.

When should you disclose A I involvement?

Professional contexts often have policies. Many employers, publishers, and institutions now have guidelines about A I disclosure. Know and follow them.

Academic work typically requires disclosure. Using A I without acknowledgment in academic settings may violate academic integrity policies.

When it would be misleading not to. If someone assumes work is entirely human created and that assumption matters, disclosure is important.

When asked directly. Always answer honestly about A I involvement when someone asks.

How to disclose appropriately.

Match disclosure to context. A casual email might not need formal acknowledgment. A published article or important report likely does.

Be specific when it matters. Saying A I assisted with research versus A I wrote this document communicates different levels of involvement.

Don't over disclose. Not every A I interaction needs announcement. Use judgment about what's relevant.

Honesty extends to how you represent A I outputs.

Don't claim false expertise. If A I helped you understand something, you don't become an expert in it.

Verify before vouching. Only stand behind information you've verified.

Acknowledge limitations. If you're not certain about something, say so.

Transparency isn't about confession. It's about maintaining trust and setting appropriate expectations.
