A I systems can reflect and amplify biases. Understanding this helps you use A I more responsibly.

Where does bias come from? A I learns from data created by humans. If that data reflects historical biases, A I learns them. If certain groups are underrepresented in training data, A I may serve them less well.

How does bias appear? A I might make assumptions based on names, locations, or other characteristics. It might default to certain perspectives while overlooking others. It might perpetuate stereotypes present in its training data.

What can you do about it?

Be aware. Simply knowing that bias exists helps you watch for it. Question A I outputs that seem to make assumptions about people or groups.

Seek diverse perspectives. Ask A I explicitly for multiple viewpoints. Request consideration of different groups. Don't accept a single perspective as complete.

Check for fairness. When A I assists with decisions affecting people, consider who might be disadvantaged. Are you treating similar situations similarly?

Provide context. Tell A I about the specific people or situations involved rather than relying on generalizations.

Use your judgment. A I suggestions are starting points, not final decisions. Apply your own values and knowledge to assess fairness.

You can't eliminate all bias. But you can be thoughtful about it. Awareness and active questioning make a significant difference.
