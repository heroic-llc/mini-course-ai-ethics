Let's establish core principles for ethical A I use.

First, honesty. Be truthful about A I involvement. If A I helped create something, acknowledge it when appropriate. Don't present A I work as entirely your own when that's misleading.

Second, accuracy. Verify what A I tells you before sharing or acting on it. Spreading A I misinformation, even unintentionally, causes harm. You're responsible for the accuracy of what you share.

Third, fairness. Be aware that A I can reflect and amplify biases. Consider who might be affected by A I-assisted decisions. Ask whether the approach treats people equitably.

Fourth, transparency. In professional contexts, follow guidelines about A I disclosure. Many organizations and publications have policies. When in doubt, be more transparent rather than less.

Fifth, human responsibility. A I is a tool. You remain responsible for how you use it. You can't blame A I for unethical choices. The decisions are yours.

Sixth, respect for others. Consider how A I use affects other people. Their privacy, their work, their reputation. A I shouldn't be used to deceive, manipulate, or harm.

These principles aren't complicated. They're extensions of basic ethical behavior into a new technological context.

When facing A I decisions, return to these fundamentals. They'll guide you well.
