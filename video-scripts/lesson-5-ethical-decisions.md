Let me share a framework for making ethical A I decisions.

When facing an uncertain situation, ask these questions.

Who could be affected? Consider all stakeholders. Not just you, but colleagues, clients, the public, specific groups.

What are the potential harms? Could this spread misinformation? Violate privacy? Disadvantage certain people? Enable deception?

What would a reasonable person expect? Would they expect A I involvement to be disclosed? Would they feel deceived if they learned how this was created?

What are the norms in this context? What do professional standards, organizational policies, and community expectations require?

Am I comfortable being transparent? If you'd be uncomfortable explaining your A I use, that's a signal something might be wrong.

Common ethical pitfalls to avoid.

Using A I to deceive. Creating fake testimonials, impersonating people, spreading misinformation.

Avoiding responsibility. Blaming A I for problems that resulted from your choices.

Ignoring policies. Using A I in ways that violate agreed upon rules.

Cutting corners on verification. Sharing A I output without checking accuracy.

Ethics isn't about perfection. It's about thoughtfulness. When you're uncertain, pause and reflect. Consider the principles we've discussed. Ask for guidance when needed.

You now have a foundation for ethical A I use. Apply these principles, and you'll navigate A I's challenges responsibly.
